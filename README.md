# Unity Basic Project #

A boilerplate project that many games could take advantage of. As it is a basic Unity project to start with. I used some portions of it in my game projects, now writing it so that it's more usable in projects to come.

Also, It is structured properly with the namespace that it would not conflict with your code at any time.

### Module/Feature list: ###
* **Singleton** - generic singleton which can be used to implement managers
* **MonoDirect** - solution to Monobehaviour function callbacks (called through reflections) which can be slow in most cases and could be the reason of lag
* **SceneController** - which should be used to switch scenes
* **ReportEmail** - email reporting module which allows you to mail console data to given email address
* **GameLogger** - allows you to log with a lot of features like color, timestamp, italics, bold etc.
* **MonoExtension** - includes a lot of extension methods like InvokeExtension, UpdateExtension, AlphaFade etc.
* **WebAudioClip** - allows you to download audio file from given URL
